# Random-Network
An application of generating random network that was mentioned in "Network Science by Albert-László Barabási"book.
A brief qout  from the book:
Real Networks are Not Random
Since its introduction in 1959 the random network model has dominated mathematical approaches to complex networks. The model suggests that the random-looking networks observed in complex systems should be described as purely random. With that it equated complexity with randomness. We must therefore ask:

Do we really believe that real networks are random?

The answer is clearly no. As the interactions between our proteins are governed by the strict laws of biochemistry, for the cell to function its chemical architecture cannot be random. Similarly, in a random society an American student would be as likely to have among his friends Chinese factory workers than one of her classmates.

The degree to which random networks describe, or fail to describe, real systems, must not be decided by epistemological arguments, but by a systematic quantitative comparison. We can do this, taking advantage of the fact that random network theory makes a number of quantitative predictions:

Degree Distribution
A random network has a binomial distribution, well approximated by a Poisson distribution in the k « N limit. Yet, the Poisson distribution fails to capture the degree distribution of real networks. In real systems we have more highly connected nodes than the random network model could account for.

Connectedness
Random network theory predicts that for ‹k› › 1 we should observe a giant component, a condition satisfied by all networks we examined. Most networks, however, do not satisfy the ‹k› › lnN condition, implying that they should be broken into isolated clusters. Some networks are indeed fragmented, most are not.

Clustering Coefficient
In a random network the local clustering coefficient is independent of the node’s degree and ‹C› depends on the system size as 1/N. In contrast, measurements indicate that for real networks C(k) decreases with the node degrees and is largely independent of the system size.
